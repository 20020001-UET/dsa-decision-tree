# Decision Tree - DSA Assignment

## Introduction

**Decision Tree** is an assignment in the **Data structure and Algorithms** (*DSA*) Course of UET (***University of Engineering and Technology***).  
Course lecturer: **BSc. Pham Dinh Tuan**.

## Usage

### Input

The basic input is **Data** which have 4 attributes called `<att1>, <att2>, <att3>, <att4>` and 1 label which can be L (*left*), R (*right*) v√† B (*balance*).  
Input data is splited into three different parts:  
- The **training part** is file [`train.txt`]() which is being used to train the decision tree.  
- The **public test** is file [`valid.txt`]() which is being used to test the prediction of the tree. All the data in **valid** have its own label, so we can check if our tree had predicted the right lable of each data.  
- The **private test** is file [`private.txt`]() which is being used to test the prediction of the tree and the answer is given to our lecturer for assignment's score. Note that all the data in **private** don't have its own label!  

### Output

The basic output is **Label** of one prediction based on 4 attributes in the basic data. Our goal is building a decision tree which can predict the **Label** of a given **Data** and improve the prediction accuracy of the tree.  
Output data is splited into two parts:
- The **output** is file [`outputFromTerminal`]() which has the best output prediction accuracy of the tree that we had tested since the project started.  
- The **private answer** is file [`result.txt`]() which contains the answer for the **private test**.  
- The **saved tree** is file [`savedData.txt`]() which contains the data is exported from tree and can be import to build a tree. We store the best model of decision tree in this file!
